# bikesharing

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to gather and evaluate data from the New York Citibike bicycle sharing program to discover key information and trends to facilitate the origin of a similar program in Des Moines. 

## Results

Please view my Tableau project for visualizations of the data from this project:

A selection of pages from my Tableau project have been shown below, each with a brief interpretation of the findings.

^ Unsurprisingly, the later the hour of the day, the more bikes in use to a point, at which the inverse becomes true the later it gets.

^ Significantly more males were customers in the Citibike program than females.

^ On weekdays, the busiest hours were 7:00-9:00am and 5:00-7:00pm, while on weekends, the midday 10:00am-4:00pm were the busiest.

^ The data were not statistically significant for "unknown" gender, while male and female followed the overall trends of general usage hours.

^ By far, male subscribers were the biggest users of the bike share program every day of the week.

^ The longest trips are taken by those born ~1970 and after 2000, suggesting that "Generation X" and "Generation Z" make up a large portion of the target audience.

^ Another illustration of the trend towards busiest use during typical commute hours (7:00-8:00am and 5:00-6:00pm)


## Summary
Based on the findings represented in these data analyses and visualizations, we recommend targeting males under 55 years old as a target audience. To grow the number of users, however, I suggest the following two future analyses: 1) What types of neighborhoods/areas of the city see the most use. Finding that out could help promote use near university areas where students may not have access to cars and may instead elect to use a bikeshare program to get around. 2) What socioeconomic statuses use the bike the most? If the cost is a barrier to users, discount vouchers or city government partnerships could increase ridership.
